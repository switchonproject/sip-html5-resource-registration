# SIP HTML5 Resource Registration Online Form 

A simple online form for registering new hydrological open data resources in the SIP.
The SWITCH-ON resource registration process follows a two step approach:
- 1st **Anybody** that finds interesting open data resources on the web can fill in a simple online form that asks for a *minimal* set of meta-information about the resources
- 2nd The meta-information and the resource data is reviewed by an **hydrological expert** (a member of the SWITCH-ON consortium). This Expert uses our [SIP Expert GUI](https://switchonproject.github.io/cids-custom-switchon/) and the **Meta-Data Wizard** to register the resource in the SIP Meta-Data Repository, therby possibly enhancing the Meta-Data of the resource.
